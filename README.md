# Databricks-Training
Some very simple training materials for Databricks

The Data Exploration on Databricks notebook needs the apache.access.logs file and also response.csv
If I get time I will add some geolocation for the ip addresses

The streaming files will need access to an Azure Blob Storage account, an Azure Cognitive Text Analytics Service and an Azure Event Hub.

TODO - Slides and written instructions for creating a basic cluster and uploading data.
